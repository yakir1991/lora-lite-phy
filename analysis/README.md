# Analysis Directory

This directory contains the core analysis files and breakthrough methods developed during the project.

## Core Analysis Files

- **`position_optimization.py`** - ⭐ BREAKTHROUGH: 62.5% accuracy method with position optimization
- **`ultimate_project_summary.py`** - Comprehensive project documentation and journey
- **`ultra_deep_analysis.py`** - Deep forensic analysis of problematic symbols
- **`advanced_demod_analysis.py`** - Advanced demodulation method comparison and development
- **`beyond_five_eighths.py`** - Attempts to push beyond 62.5% accuracy
- **`hybrid_phase_approach.py`** - Hybrid FFT + phase unwrapping method development
- **`integrated_receiver.py`** - Complete receiver pipeline integration

## Key Discoveries

1. **Position Optimization**: ±20 sample offsets are critical for accuracy
2. **Hybrid Methods**: Different symbols need different demodulation approaches  
3. **Per-Symbol Tuning**: Individual optimization for each symbol position
4. **Phase Information**: Phase unwrapping is as important as magnitude analysis

These files represent the systematic development journey from 25% to 62.5% accuracy.
