# Local Modifications (Submodule)

This submodule (`external/gr_lora_sdr`) is tracked locally with minimal tweaks to ease reproducible vector generation inside this repository. Changes are not pushed upstream; consider forking the submodule if you intend to publish a derivative.

## Summary of changes
- Replace hardcoded absolute paths with project‑relative paths:
  - `examples/tx_rx_simulation.grc`: file sinks/sources now point to `vectors/...` within the root project.
  - `tx_rx_simulation.py` (generated by grcc): adjusted file source/sink paths to `vectors/...`.
- No behavioral changes to signal processing blocks.

## Notes
- If you re‑generate `tx_rx_simulation.py` via `grcc`, the absolute paths may re‑appear; please adjust them to relative paths (e.g., `vectors/...`).
- For long‑term maintenance, consider creating a fork of `gr-lora_sdr` that bakes in relative paths and publishes a matching branch/tag.
